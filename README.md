# Messenger

### About

It is our advanced modul project. We decided to build a messenger application where users can
chat with each other in real time. 

### Technologies

For the backend part we use Java with Spring framework and for the frontend part we use 
Javascript with React.
Besides, for the authentication we are using Spring security with JWT token,
our database is Postgresql and we are using JPA with Hibernate.
For the components at the frontend we are using the MaterialUI library.

### Features

First of all this is a messenger application so the basic messenger functionalities like adding friends, online status, login-logout.
Besides we are planning to add some customization for user profile which means that users can change their chat theme, status message and profile picture.

### Status

Currently, we are working on the Websocket protocol this is the last missing part for our working messenger application.
After that we will add the plus functionalities like changing theme and profile picture and status message.
We have already a working landing page with login and registration a main page where we can send messages.
The main page frontend is fully implemented it's almost ready to use just the websocket implementation missing yet.
